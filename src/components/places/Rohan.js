            <p>Rohan is a fictional kingdom of Men in J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy setting of Middle-earth. Known for its horsemen, the Rohirrim, Rohan provides its ally Gondor with cavalry. Its territory is mainly grassland. The Rohirrim call their land the Mark or the Riddermark, names recalling that of the historical kingdom of Mercia, the region of Western England where Tolkien lived.</p>
            <p>Rohan is located in the north-west of Middle-earth, between the Misty Mountains and the White Mountains. Its capital is Edoras, a white city built on a hilltop. Rohan is ruled by a king, and its people are divided into clans. The Rohirrim are a proud and independent people, and they are known for their skill in horsemanship and warfare. They are also devout followers of the Valar, the angelic beings who created Middle-earth.</p>
            <p>Rohan is a major player in the events of The Lord of the Rings. The Rohirrim come to the aid of Gondor in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, and they play a key role in the defeat of Sauron. Rohan is a land of beauty and courage, and its people are a source of hope and inspiration.</p>
